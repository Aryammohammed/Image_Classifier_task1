Simple image classification using Teachable Machine
# 🎯 Task 1: Simple Image Classification

This project uses **Teachable Machine by Google** to train a custom image classification model, then tests it using **Python**.

## 📁 Files Included
- `keras_Model.h5` → The trained model
- `labels.txt` → Class labels
- `predict.py` → Python script to load and test the model
- `test3.jpg` → Sample image for prediction
-`Screenshot` → Screenshot of the prediction result

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries:
```bash
pip install tensorflow pillow numpy
Run the script in your terminal:

bash
python predict.py
You'll see output like:

Class: France
Confidence Score: 92.35%

📸 Sample Output
